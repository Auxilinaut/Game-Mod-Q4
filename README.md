### Project Pizza
#### Quake 4 game mod by Justin Johnson
##### For IT266 @ NJIT, Professor Kehoe

To build, open "q4sdk.sln" and build as x86 for release. The DLL (Gamex86.dll) will be put up a folder in "Win32".

In the "gamemod" folder, open "game000.pk4" in 7zip and replace the DLL.

Copy the "gamemod" folder into your Quake 4 folder next to "q4base".

Either use the provided "Quake 4.lnk" (bonus points if your q4base resides in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4) or switch the mod in-game to "gamemod". The mod can be played on any map.

Mods:
* Pizza weapons: Blaster, Hyperblaster, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, Napalm Gun
* Pizza guy abilities: Eat pizza (crouch key), Sprint (walk key), Skip (jump key)
* Stunned due to absolute satisfaction, aliens and marines that you feed pizza to will go dormant

Todo:
* Change skip to double jump
* Add pizza topping item pickups
